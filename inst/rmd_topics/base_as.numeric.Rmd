### Description

The `as.numeric()` function comes with R and is part of the Base R `{base}` package.
  
We use this function to _coerce_ a value or variable to be a numeric, i.e. change the variable's type into a numeric type. 

Not all values can be changed to numeric, and this function will return `NA` if the value could not be coerced.




## Conceptual usage 

```{r usage, eval=FALSE}
as.numeric(value to coerce into numeric type)
```

### Examples


```{r example1}
# Convert the string "10" to the number 10
as.numeric("10")
```

<br>  <!-- Do not delete the <br>, and make sure to keep the previous and following lines blank. -->

```{r example2, warning=TRUE}
# This example will return NA since there is no natural way to coerce the argument into a numeric
# It will also reveal a warning message telling you the coercion wasn't possible
as.numeric("you can't make strings into numbers")
```

<br>  <!-- Do not delete the <br>, and make sure to keep the previous and following lines blank. -->


```{r example3}
# The logical `TRUE` turns into 1 when coerced to be a number. 
# This is consistent across all programming languages that allow coersion.
as.numeric(TRUE)
```


<br>  <!-- Do not delete the <br>, and make sure to keep the previous and following lines blank. -->


```{r example4}
# The logical `FALSE` turns into 0 when coerced to be a number. 
# This is consistent across all programming languages that allow coersion.
as.numeric(FALSE)
```
