### Description

The `nchar()` function comes with `R` and is part of the Base `R` `{base}` package.
  
We use this function to determine the how many characters (**n**umber of **char**acters) in a string. Unfortunately, it is pronounced "en-char."


### Conceptual Usage 

```{r usage, eval=FALSE}
nchar(string to count number of characters in)
```

### Examples


```{r example1}
# Find the number of characters in a string directly
nchar("word")
```

<br>  <!-- Do not delete the <br>, and make sure to keep the previous and following lines blank. -->


```{r example2}
# Find the number of characters in a string with multiple words
nchar("This is a whole sentence.")
```

<br>  <!-- Do not delete the <br>, and make sure to keep the previous and following lines blank. -->


```{r example3}
# Find the number of characters in a string that was previously defined as a variable.
my_string <- "heyo!"
nchar(my_string)
```
