## Description

The [`geom_jitter()`](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/reference/geom_jitter.html) function is part of the [`{ggplot2}`](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/) package, which is part of the [`{tidyverse}`](https://www.tidyverse.org/).

The `geom_jitter()` function is used within `{ggplot2}` plots to create strip plots, also know as jitter plots. (Note that `geom_jitter()` is technically a shortcut for `geom_point(position = position_jitter())`.)

#### Required aesthetics:

+ `x`: The x-axis coordinate(s) for the points (pre-jittering)
+ `y`: The y-axis coordinate(s) for the points (pre-jittering)
 

#### Commonly used optional aesthetics:

+ `color` (`colour`): The point color
+ `fill`: The point fill, when the shape is specified to allow a fill 
+ `size`: The point size
+ `shape`: The point shape
+ `stroke`: The point outline size, when the shape is specified to allow a fill 
+ `alpha`: Point transparency, ranging from 0-1 where 0 is fully transparent and 1 is fully opaque.
+ `width`: The separation between jitter distributions. _It is good practice to always find an appropriate width for your data!_

#### Options for point shapes in R

The default point shape used for plotting is **20**.

<!-- Add the following if the topic is a function that does NOT come with base R, and uncomment/fill in the subsequent multiline HTML comment: -->
To use this function, you need to either first load the `{ggplot2}` library, or always use the function with `ggplot2::geom_jitter()` notation.

```{r description, eval=FALSE}
# Load the library
library(ggplot2)
# Or, load the full tidyverse:
library(tidyverse)

# Or, use :: notation
ggplot2::geom_jitter()
```



## Examples

> Run `get_help("msleep")` for a refresher on the `msleep` dataset.

```{r example1}
# Jitter plot of awake against vore, colored by vore for clarity
# Note to remove NAs, you must manipulate the data first
ggplot(msleep) + 
  aes(x = vore, y = awake, color = vore) + 
  geom_jitter()
```

<br>

```{r example2}
# Modify the spacing along the x-axis with the width argument
# Note to remove NAs, you must manipulate the data first
ggplot(msleep) + 
  aes(x = vore, y = awake, color = vore) + 
  geom_jitter(width = 0.1)
```

<br>

```{r example3}
# Examples of further point modifications, shown comprehensively
# Note to remove NAs, you must manipulate the data first
ggplot(msleep) + 
  aes(x = vore, y = awake) + 
  geom_jitter(width = 0.15,
              shape = 22,
              size = 4,
              stroke = 2, # point outline width
              color = "orange",
              fill = "blue",
              alpha = 0.5)
```

<br>

```{r example4}
# To make a single jitter plot containing all values, use aes(x = "")
ggplot(msleep) + 
  aes(x = "", y = awake) + 
  geom_jitter(width = 0.2)
```
