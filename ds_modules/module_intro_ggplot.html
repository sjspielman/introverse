<h2>Background: The <code>ggplot2</code> package</h2>
<p>This lab focuses on making figures using the <code>ggplot2</code> package, which is one of several <a href="https://tidyverse.tidyverse.org/"><code>tidyverse</code></a> packages. To obtain <code>ggplot2</code>, you will need to first <em>install</em> the library, and then <em>load</em> the library for use in your current R session. <strong>The library has already been installed for you</strong>, but IF you were to install it, here’s what you would do!</p>
<p>The command to install packages is <code>install.packages()</code> - you must provide package names <em>in quotes!</em> to this function:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>install.packages(&quot;ggplot2&quot;)</code></pre>
<p>You may see red text going down the console - don’t worry! These are just messages indicating the stage of installation; they are not errors. <strong>You only need to run package installation ONCE within a given RStudio Cloud space (or, once on your computer)</strong>. Once it has been installed, you can use the package by loading it when needed.</p>
<p>Once this package installation completes, you can load packages for use with the <code>library()</code> function (quotes or no quotes, doesn’t matter here):</p>
<pre class="r"><code>library(ggplot2)
# or, library(&quot;ggplot2), or library(&#39;ggplot2&#39;)</code></pre>
<p><strong>AGAIN, THIS HAS BEEN DONE FOR YOU IN THESE INTERACTIVE EXERCISES! YOU DON’T NEED TO RUN THIS CODE!!</strong></p>

<div id="section-exploring-the-data-with-r" class="section level3">
<h3>Exploring the data with R</h3>
<p>All exercises here will use a pre-loaded dataset called <code>sparrows</code>. This dataset was collected in 1898 by Hermon Bumpus, an American biologist working at Brown University (fun fact: Dr. Spielman’s <em>alma mater</em>!). Immediately following a bad winter storm, he collected 136 English house sparrows (some alive, some dead), <em>Passer domesticus</em>, and brought them indoors. Of these birds, 64 had died during the storm, but 72 recovered and survived. Bumpus measured the birds’ physical traits (in mm or g) and recorded them for future generations of data science students.</p>
<p><strong>Before you begin the exercises, examine the dataset here!! AS A GENERAL RULE, you should ALWAYS ALWAYS ALWAYS look at data before (and while!) plotting!!</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Begin exploring the dataset by running the code <code>head(sparrows)</code>. The function <code>head()</code> will show you the first 6 rows of the data frame.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>On this website ONLY (but not within R console), this table will display interactively so you can scroll across columns. In “real R”, there is no “point-and-click”.</p>

<p>Each row in the dataset records a single <em>observation</em> - in other words, each row corresponds to an individual sparrow. Each column contains a variable that</p>
<ul>
<li>You can also use the functions <code>nrow()</code>, <code>ncol()</code>, and <code>names()</code> to quickly see, respectively, the number of rows in the data frame, the number of columns in the data frame, and the column (variable!) names of the data frame. Try it out below:</li>

ncol(sparrows)

<li>You can quickly see all the datatypes of the data frame’s columns with the function <code>str()</code>. Try it below:

<p>You will see the dataset has three categorical variables that R refers to as “factors.” Each of these variables has two <em>levels</em>, which means “categories in the categorical variable.” In this dataset, for example, the variable <code>Age</code> has three levels: <code>Adult</code>, <code>Juvenile</code>, and <code>Young</code>. You will see the remaining 9 variables are all numeric continuous.</p>
<ul>
<li>Use the function <code>summary()</code> to get something magical: A quick summary of each variable in the dataset! For factor variables, this command tells you the count of each level. For numeric variales, this command gives you the five-number summary and the mean.</li>

Run the code below to see this in action, and then adapt the code to look at the variable <code>Sex</code> instead of <code>Wingspread</code>.</li>

<h3>Ok, here’s the data</h3>
<p>Now that you have explored the dataset for yourself using R code, here it is for you to explore interactively!</p>
<p>When making figures of this dataset, remember to <em>look at it often</em>! Nobody ever expects you to memorize column names. You can always use one of the functions you practiced above to remind yourself how to spell column names (case matters! If the variable is <code>Age</code>, R will not understand <code>age</code> since the “a” is lowercase), what a given column’s datatype is, etc.</p>

<p>The <code>geom_point()</code> geom can accept several visual features, which can either be plainly specified to <code>geom_point()</code> or specified as an <em>aesthetic</em> if they map to the data. The most important ones are:</p>

<li><code>color</code>: Color of points
<ul>
<li><em>Certain</em> types of points can also have a <code>fill</code> (question 9 below)</li>
</ul></li>
<li><code>size</code>: Size of points</li>
<li><code>shape</code>: Shape of points</li>
<li>For more, check out the <a href="https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/reference/geom_point.html"><code>geom_point()</code> documentation</a> and scroll to “Aesthetics”, and then <em>keep scrolling for Examples!</em>.</li>

<h4><strong>PAUSE!</strong> for an important learning opportunity</h4>
<p>Look at the solution code provided for the previous exercise. Below, I write the exact same code again, but <em>all on one line</em> (the text is “wrapped” in the window you see, so it appears on multiple lines but technically it is not!). As you will notice, it is an absolute pain to read, and <em>because it is poorly organized</em>, it is extremely challenging to get any coherent sense of what the code is doing.</p>

<p>When crafting plots with <code>ggplot2</code>, it is <strong>strongly recommended (aka I will absolutely grade you on this)</strong> to space out your code like my solutions demonstrate. Every time you add the next function, start a new line. Remember to keep the plus sign <code>+</code> at the END of a line! If you don’t end a line with the <code>+</code>, R will think the command is over - it won’t know to check if there’s a plus sign coming up. You’ll also notice in the <code>labs()</code> function, I separate arguments one line at a time, again making sure the comma falls at the END of a line and never at the beginning.</p>

</div>
<p>What if we wanted the order to be different and show the variables in biological order: “Juvenile”, “Young”, and finally “Adult” last? There are several strategies to accomplish this task. We will learn how to do this using a function from the package <a href="https://forcats.tidyverse.org/reference/"><code>forcats</code></a>, a <code>tidyverse</code> package that helps change the order of a factor variable. The package name involves several puns, and the library has been pre-loaded for you in these exercises.</p>
<p>Here, we will use the function <code>fct_relevel()</code> from <code>forcats</code>. This function take TWO arguments: the variable to reorder (<code>Age</code>) and an <em>array</em> (defined with <code>c()</code>!) of the new order of levels you want to plot[^This is only sort of true - there are other advanced ways to use this function which can you explore <a href="https://forcats.tidyverse.org/reference/fct_relevel.html">here</a> if you want a deeper dive.]. Here, that would be:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>MAKE SURE TO SPELL THE CATEGORIES EXACTLY AS THEY ALREADY EXIST, WITH THE SAME CAPITALIZATION</strong>! If “Young” is one of the categories and you spell it “Yong” or “young,” this strategy will not work.</p>
</blockquote>
<pre class="r"><code># First argument is the column we want to reorder, Age.
# Second argument is an *array* of the new order. These are strings, so use quotes!
fct_relevel(Age, c(&quot;Juvenile&quot;, &quot;Young&quot;, &quot;Adult&quot;))


# Or, improve your coding style by creating and using a separate variable for your new order:
# This removes the hardcoding from your code.
age_new_order &lt;- c(&quot;Juvenile&quot;, &quot;Young&quot;, &quot;Adult&quot;)
fct_relevel(Age, age_new_order)</code></pre>
<p>This code is further <em>embedded</em> within the actual <code>ggplot()</code> code. Instead of typing to <code>Age</code> in the <code>ggplot()</code> command, we literally type this whole statement. See for yourself below:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This code will NOT change the <code>sparrows</code> data frame at all - the <code>Age</code> column’s default order remains the same. This code will only modify the order of <code>Age</code> levels for the plot.</p>

It suggests ONE way you can customize the binning: Using the argument <code>binwidth</code> to <code>geom_histogram()</code> to specify how wide along the X-axis a bin should be.

<li>After you make your colored and filled histogram, also add “just a size” (use a value below 3, trust me…) to your histogram with the argument <code>size</code> to see what this argument does in histograms.</li>
<li>Then, make all your visual features (fill, color, and size) variables to use in your plot rather than the direct values, similar to how you practiced with <code>my_bins</code> in the previous question.
<ul>
<li>Make sure to choose <em>meaningful variable names.</em> In other words, <code>my_bins</code> is a lot more meaningful than <code>x</code>! Adopting this “coding best practice” makes your code easier for YOU to read, write, and work with.</li>

<blockquote>
<p>You may need to customize the <em>spacing</em> of the points in the strip plot so that it is <em>totally unambiguous</em> which point belongs to which x-axis category. You can do this with the argument <code>width</code> to <code>geom_jitter()</code>. I have personally found that 0.1-0.3 is usually a nice range for this argument. Fun fact: <code>geom_jitter()</code> is actually just a special version of <code>geom_point()</code>, so all point aesthetics apply here. In fact, <code>geom_jitter()</code> is just a shortcut for the more annoying-to-write <code>geom_point(position = position_jitter())</code>!! You may want to change the size of points to make everything cleanly visible. Perhaps the plot would also benefit from some transparency to the points? The “jittering” to the points is random, so every time you re-make the plot, the specific x-location of the points will change. Think: Why should the Y location NEVER change?
